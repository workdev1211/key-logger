Description: # Keylogger
        
        **Keylogger** is simple keylogger for Windows, Linux and Mac.
        ## Installation
        
        The following instructions will install Keylogger with pip Python package manager.
        
        ### pip
        
        This installs the latest stable, released version.
        
        ```
          $ pip install keylogger
        ```
        
        ## How to run it
        
        By running `keylogger` command, it'll start to log your strokes:
        ```
        $ keylogger
        
        RECORD extension version 1.13
        ```
        
        The Keylogger is now running! It will log your strokes to the file you specified. Stop it by hitting the grave key (Thats the one under escape on a standard keyboard). 
        
        Keylogger has several options that can be used to change output log file and change its cancel key:
        
        * `--log-file output.og`: File path to use as the log file.  Default is current directory.
        * `--cancel-key`: The key that uses as the cancel key, default is '`'.
        * `--clean-log`: clean the log file first, default is No.
        
        #### Use cases
        
        Some uses of a keylogger are:
        
        - Business Administration: Monitor what employees are doing.
        - School/Institutions: Track keystrokes and log banned words in a file.
