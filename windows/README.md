## Windows
Simply compile into an .exe, and then run. 

There are two files; klog_visible and klog_invisible. It is pretty simple, but I will expand:

`klog_visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out. `klog_invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.

Both of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.
